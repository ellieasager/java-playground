Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a pig, E-I-E-I-O
With a oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a duck, E-I-E-I-O
With a quack-quack here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack
Oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O
With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo-moo
Quack-quack here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack
Oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a mouse, E-I-E-I-O
With a squeak-squeak here and a squeak-squeak there
Here a squeak, there a squeak, everywhere a squeak-squeak
Moo-moo here and a moo-moo there
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo-moo
Quack-quack here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack
Oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
